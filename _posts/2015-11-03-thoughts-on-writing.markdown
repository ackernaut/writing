I use a website called [750 Words](http://750words.com/) to complete a minimal amount of writing every day. For a while now I have been writing almost daily. There are times when I have only written a few times a month.

I make an effort to get the writing done early in the day, if not first thing. Sometimes I catch up later in the evening. It usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes, then I move on to other tasks.

I find that writing daily forces me to articulate my thoughts on many topics. This may include work, life, faith, hobbies, problem solving, etc.

I maintain a list of writing tasks for new projects and ideas that I am working on. Sometimes I write fiction, developing characters and stories to use for book or game ideas that I have. I have some Google Docs where I collect some of the writing for further development.

I do have some tools and tips that I use to improve my hand at wordsmithing:

* [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/ "Online Etymology Dictionary")
* [Hemmingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/ "Hemmingway App")
* [You’re probably using the wrong dictionary](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary "You’re probably using the wrong dictionary")

I have decided I want to put the effort into showing my work more often, whether it be code, design, or writing. It has been a while since my last blog was alive and well. I feel that I am at a place where I can brave getting some of this writing out in the open once again.

So here is a first step.
